# Decoder Ring

Front-end web application that uses algorithmic reasoning to encode or decode messages using multiple notable ciphers from history

## Features
* User can encode a message of their choosing using the Caesar Shift, Polybius Square, or Substitution Cipher
* User can decode a given message using Caesar Shift, Polybius Square, or Substitution Cipher

## Technologies used:
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS

## Note
This application was an exercise and demonstration of algorithmic reasoning. I converted historical ciphers into JavaScript and handled edge cases to ensure the given message could be encoded or decoded.
